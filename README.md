# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – XMC7000 and TRAVEO T2G MCUs

This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers XMC7000 and TRAVEO T2G MCUs.

The material and examples demonstrate the use of peripherals such as GPIO, PWM, ADC, UART, I2C, and SPI. Some examples use
sensors from a separate shield board. The class also covers RTOS, DMA and how multicore applications work.
